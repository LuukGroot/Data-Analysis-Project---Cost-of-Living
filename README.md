#Data analysis project:
Use an online available dataset from Kaggle and prepare the data, and perform exploratory data analysis on it. Also formulate and answer several questions about the data set.

Preparing:
-For preparing the dataset I changed the column names from incoherent names such as x1,x2,...,x55, to coherent names such as "Meal cost for inexpensive meal (USD)".
-I also changed the currency of all the data from USD to EUR, since we use the Euro.

Exploratory Analsysis:
-I investigated the mean, max, range, std of the data set
-I counted the number of quality data entries
-I plotted several interesting data combination. This included using grouping and created new columns.

Questions:
I answered the following questions,
-In what fraction of cities is it reasonably affordable to live in the city centre?
-In whats cities is it the cheapest to eat out for local residents?
